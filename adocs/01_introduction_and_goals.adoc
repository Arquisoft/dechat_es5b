== Introduction and Goals
In this documentation we will explain all the relevant concepts of our decentralized chat, based on SOLID, following the Arc42 template.

Our project is part of a university proposal with a basis in cooperation with the company Inrupt and the use of its SOLID design.

In it we will provide a response to the request for a decentralized chat using SOLID. It will consist of the principle of separating the information from the application giving the user the power to control all their data.


=== Requirements Overview
It is a chat so its most basic requirements are to send and receive messages. But there are other requirements that we are going to add.

==== Chat Requirements

|====================
|Requirement | Description
|Secure | Connection protocols and personal information security
|Descentraliced | The user is the real data's owner
|Fast and Agile | Real time message syste
|Intuitive and Comfy |Easy to learn and use, familiar to the user
|====================

==== Implementation Requirements.

|====================
|Requirement | Description
|Testability | Error and bugs tracking, the architecture should allow easy testing
|Patter design | Facility to extend, update and fix
|Fast and Agile | Easiest to understand and work with it
|====================

=== Quality Goals

|Quality|Motivation
| Decentralized | Top priority and objective for the chat, is required to work...
| Usable | Chats are one of most common and famous application, is expected to be familiar and intuitive to the user
| Clean code and design | The vast majority of our Stakeholders are developers so, it is relevant to maintain a clean product during its implementation.

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| Teaching Staff | Teachers | Teacher and in charge of the subject, seeks development within a project and constant work.
| Inrupt | SOLID Team | They establish certain bases to be met in the development and operation of the application, also act as a help factor. 
| Users | Potential users | Those possible users who use the application for the technologies used and their comfort.
| Team | Developtment team | Develop a application that will work and archive at least the minimum requirements planned.
| Developers | External developers | We are deploying an open code product so it might be relevant to bring them some help by coding a clean application
