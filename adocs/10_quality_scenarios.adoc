.List of requirements

[underline]#*Most Basic requirement*#

* The first and most important is the protection towards the private information of the user, because it is the main objetive of our proyect. We will acomplish this by saving every information of the user in a POD, but only those of the user himself never those of the other users. This POD can only be accesed by the user and those who have the permission of the user.[High priority]
