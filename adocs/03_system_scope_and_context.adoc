== System Scope and Context

DeChat must allow communication between two users through text messages. In addition, it may be possible in following versions create user groups which all participants can send and receive messages. In addition, it must allow the sending of files, such as images or videos, to the recipient.

Security and privacy is DeChat priority. Messages will never leave user own Solid POD. Instead, recipient system will be asked to retrieve message from senders POD, and will never save messages to recipient POD.
DeChat will only store where message is placed, so app knows where are messages stored when user starts application.

Lists of communication partners and their interfaces:

* Main: login page where the user must enter his or her solid community credentials.
* Chat room: shows the authenticated user's friends list and the messages sent and received with the selected friend.

=== Business Context

There will be only one communication partner (one role): User. User will be able to send and receive messages. In the background, RDF will be used to share chat details. Data will be kept within sender's POD and will never be stored outside it.

=== Technical Context

Since DeChat is under SOLID architecture, we will be using WebID to communicate between users and add friends. SOLID also makes use of RDF, WebSockets, etc.. More info available in https://github.com/solid/solid-spec

As indicated above, the chat is composed of two main elements: login and chat room. It's necessary to bear in mind that the application needs a web browser to be able to use it. Here is a case of use that explains how it works:
