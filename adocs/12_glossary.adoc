| Git   | Git is a version control software designed by Linus Torvalds, thinking about the efficiency and reliability of maintaining versions of applications when they have a large number of source code files.

| GitHub    | GitHub is a platform for hosting projects using the Git version control system.

| Glossary  | The glossary contains the most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

| Interface | An interface provides a functional connection between two systems, programs or devices and allows communication at different levels allowing the exchange of information.

| SOLID Community | The mission of the Solid Community Group is to try to reshape the web by fostering a new breed of applications with capabilities above and beyond anything that exists today. Participants in this group will create applications, author technical specifications, and capture best practices.
